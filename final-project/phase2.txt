what is a column store slotted page?
    stores (tuple, attr_val) or (PK, attr_val)

How do access methods work with diff pages?
    slots not necesarily same as row store slotted page
    slots could be based on index such as first slot is < x 
    next slot is < x and < y etc

    index on attribute but compare on PK if necessary
    can point to start of "USA"

    intensity is hashed file w hash access 
    but needs a b+ tree for range queries

block vs page? 
    same thing

what is a row vs column operation?
    row operations needs to be done on entire record
    build record in column buffer, then send it to the row buffer

Why is there two differnt buffers?
    used to take advatnge of different workloads

Have a catalog that stores indexes
catalog can store size of records and tuples in files

R read
I insert
U update
    example?
T table scan
    example?

M modify
G count based on range
    ie # of coffees with intensity > x
    b+ tree
    
    example?
