-- HW2 - Q9
-- Create a trigger that enforces a semantic 
-- integrity constraint. That is when a store goes to sell a coffee
-- (i.e., a new sale is added to the SALE table), the trigger checks
-- whether the storeâ€™s remaining daily inventory is enough to handle the
-- current sale. We will assume that the inventory size for each type of
-- coffee is 200, which is reset on a daily basis. If the store does not have enough
-- remaining quantity of a coffee (i.e., the store has already sold 200 cups of
-- coffee #7 or the new SALE quantity plus prior purchases would exceed 200 cups
-- of coffee #7), the trigger should raise an exception.
